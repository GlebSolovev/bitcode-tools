[![Pre Merge Checks](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-gradle-plugin-template/workflows/Pre%20Merge%20Checks/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-gradle-plugin-template/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Pre+Merge+Checks%22)  [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cortinico/kotlin-android-template.svg)](LICENSE) ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/cortinico/kotlin-android-template?color=blue&logo=kotlin)

A simple **Gradle plugin** that provides tasks **to obtain and analyze bitcode** for any Kotlin/Native projects.

This repoistory is based on the [kotlin-gradle-plugin-template](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-gradle-plugin-template).

## How to use plugin

TODO, coming soon!

## About template setup & capabilities

### Composite Build üì¶

This template is using a [Gradle composite build](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html) to build, test and publish the plugin. This means that you don't need to run Gradle twice to test the changes on your Gradle plugin (no more `publishToMavenLocal` tricks or so).

The included build is inside the [plugin-build](plugin-build) folder.

#### `preMerge` task

A `preMerge` task on the top level build is already provided in the template. This allows you to run all the `check` tasks both in the top level and in the included build.

You can easily invoke it with:

```
./gradlew preMerge
```

If you need to invoke a task inside the included build with:

```
./gradlew -p plugin-build <task-name>
```


#### Dependency substitution

Please note that the project relies on module name/group in order for [dependency substitution](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/resolution_rules.html#sec:dependency_substitution_rules) to work properly. If you change only the plugin ID everything will work as expected. If you change module name/group, things might break and you probably have to specify a [substitution rule](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/resolution_rules.html#sub:project_to_module_substitution).


### Publishing üöÄ

This template is ready to let you publish to [Gradle Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/).

The [![Publish Plugin to Portal](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-gradle-plugin-template/workflows/Publish%20Plugin%20to%20Portal/badge.svg?branch=1.0.0)](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-gradle-plugin-template/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Publish+Plugin+to+Portal%22) Github Action will take care of the publishing whenever you **push a tag**.

Please note that you need to configure two secrets: `GRADLE_PUBLISH_KEY` and `GRADLE_PUBLISH_SECRET` with the credetials you can get from your profile on the Gradle Portal.

### Static Analysis üîç

This template is using [**ktlint**](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) with the [ktlint-gradle](https://github.com/jlleitschuh/ktlint-gradle) plugin to format your code. To reformat all the source code as well as the buildscript you can run the `ktlintFormat` gradle task.

This template is also using [**detekt**](https://github.com/arturbosch/detekt) to analyze the source code, with the configuration that is stored in the [detekt.yml](config/detekt/detekt.yml) file (the file has been generated with the `detektGenerateConfig` task).

### CI ‚öôÔ∏è

This template is using [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-android-template/actions) as CI. You don't need to setup any external service and you should have a running CI once you start using this template.

There are currently the following workflows available:
- [Validate Gradle Wrapper](.github/workflows/gradle-wrapper-validation.yml) - Will check that the gradle wrapper has a valid checksum
- [Pre Merge Checks](.github/workflows/pre-merge.yaml) - Will run the `preMerge` tasks as well as trying to run the Gradle plugin.
- [Publish to Plugin Portal](.github/workflows/publish-plugin.yaml) - Will run the `publishPlugin` task when pushing a new tag.
